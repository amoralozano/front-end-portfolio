        <div class="card-body1"> -->
        <p>
          Growing up I have learned many different concepts. One of those concepts is that nothing is ever free. If you want to
          succeed in life you to have to put in the time and dedication. I have learned that no matter what happens you always have to put yourself first before others. The only person you are responsible for is yourself.
          From a young age I was taught that resposibility is what encourages people to succeed. I know now that if I want to be successful I have to put in the time and work to make it happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life isn't easy and that's something that a lot of people don't understand. Nothing is easy in this world and if it was, life would not be the same.
          Life can be hard at times and sometimes we want to give up... but what makes us strogner is learning from those mistakes we make and getting back up.
          We get challenged at all times but its only part of life and if we give up someone else won't.
        </p>

        <p>
          I dont ever give up even in the darkest of days (even though we all have felt like giving up at times). i know there is always a solution exept for death. the same way in programing, theres so many outcomes and so many ways that things can be done and solved.

        <h3>kfc</h3>
        <p>
          My first job was at KFC and I worked there for 3 years. I stared off as a cook at the age of 16 and at the age of 18 i was promoted to Shift Supervisor.
          As a Shift Supervisor i was expected to treat others with respect, and also to be a role model to others, and also to be smart with
          decision making moments, and how to handle them the best way posible. That included food calling decisions, customer conflict, employee conflicts and issues with other employees or customers,
          to make the best decision posible when making a system to serve guests in the best way possible.
        </p>
        <h3>T-Mobile</h3>
        <p>
          my second job is at T-mobile mobile and my current position is a Mobile Asociate. As a Mobile asociate im in charge of helping customers with phone activations, phone isssues,
          billing issues, and any questions they have regarding their device or service and helping them find the best option for the best plan and best device for them and for all their needs.
