        <h2>üìú my mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up I have learned many different concepts. One of those concepts is that nothing is ever free. If you want to
          succeed in life you to have to put in the time and dedication. I have learned that no matter what happens you always have to put yourself first before others. The only person you are responsible for is yourself.
          From a young age I was taught that resposibility is what encourages people to succeed. I know now that if I want to be successful I have to put in the time and work to make it happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life isnt easy and thats something that alot of people dont understand. nothing is easy in this world and if it was life would not be the same.
          Life can be hard at times and sometimes we want to give up... but what makes us strogner is learning from those mistakes we make and getting back up.
          we get chalanged at all times but its only part of life and if we give up someone else wont.
        </p>

        <p>
          I dont ever give up even in the darkest of days. i know there is always a solution exept for death. the same way in programing, theres so many outcomes and so many ways that things can be done.
